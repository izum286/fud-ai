## What's New (v3.2)
```
Fud AI 3.2 — body fat tracking, Coach reaches your full history, and smart daily reminders.

NEW
• Body fat tracking — log readings over time, set a goal %, see your composition trend on the Progress chart alongside weight. Optional: only shown if you opt in during onboarding or set a value in Settings → Profile.
• Apple Health body fat sync — readings flow both ways with Apple Health. Smart-scale data (Withings, Renpho, Eufy, etc.) auto-imports into Fud AI. First time you enable HK sync, years of historical scale data backfills into the chart.
• Unified Weight / Body Fat chart — segmented toggle on the Progress card lets you flip between metrics. Swipe horizontally on the chart to switch.
• Coach gets your full history — instead of seeing only the last 10 weights or 14 days of food, Coach can now fetch any date range on demand. Ask "what was my weight in March?" or "show me my body fat trend over the last 6 months" and it pulls exactly what it needs.
• Use Body Fat for BMR toggle — non-destructive escape hatch in Settings → Profile. When your body fat reading is stale, flip off to fall back to Mifflin-St Jeor without losing the value.
• Log Weight + Log Body Fat reminders — two new smart daily nudges (Settings → Notifications). Skip firing on days you've already logged. Body fat default off (most people don't measure daily).
• Search saved meals — search bar in the Saved Meals sheet filters Recents / Frequent / Favorites separately.
• Decimal weight pickers — pick 72.4 kg or 158.3 lbs without typing in onboarding's Height & Weight + Goal Weight steps.
• Custom AI Instructions — optional text box in Settings → AI Provider. Anything you put there (region, dietary preferences, athletic goals, brand preferences) is sent with every AI request, so you don't have to repeat context for every meal.
• Fallback AI Provider — opt-in toggle in Settings → AI Provider. If your primary provider fails (overload, rate limit, network error), the app auto-retries with a second provider you configure. Pair a paid model as primary with a free model as fallback for cheap reliability.

Polish
• Onboarding loader is now a single brand-pink gradient (was pink → blue).
• Restacked Onboarding Height & Weight imperial layout so the lbs wheel stops collapsing on narrow columns.
• OpenRouter now defaults to a free vision model so you can test the integration without loading credits.

Bug fixes
• Favorites no longer lose their image when the source food log entry is deleted.
• Gender no longer flips to "Other" for users without a HealthKit biological sex value.
• Photo + text analysis is more reliable — better tolerance for AI responses with prose or markdown around the JSON, fewer "Could not understand the AI response" errors.
