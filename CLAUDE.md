# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project

Fud AI is an open-source calorie tracker. The iOS client (SwiftUI, iOS 17.6+) lives in `ios/` — shipping on the App Store at v3.1. The Android client (Kotlin + Jetpack Compose, min SDK 26) lives in `android/` — feature-parity port, v1.0.2 in Play Store closed testing. The marketing website (plain HTML/CSS, deployed to Vercel at https://fud-ai.app) lives in `web/`. Both clients work the same way: snap/speak/type a meal, an AI provider returns nutrition JSON, the user reviews it, and it lands in the food store + Apple Health (iOS) or Health Connect (Android). There's also a "Coach" tab — multi-turn AI chat that sees the user's full profile, weight history, and food log and answers questions like "what's my expected weight in 30 days?". Bring-your-own-key model; all data is local. No subscriptions, no sign-in, no cloud sync.

## Build, Install, Launch (iOS)

The app is tested on Apoorv's physical iPhone (iPhone 16, device ID `E2095CDC-E117-527C-818A-9F741A145103`). After every change run all three commands. The Release config is intentional — it matches what users actually see. `-derivedDataPath ios/build` keeps the build output at a known location so the install path doesn't depend on Xcode's hashed DerivedData folder.

```bash
# Build
xcodebuild -project ios/calorietracker.xcodeproj -scheme calorietracker \
  -destination 'id=E2095CDC-E117-527C-818A-9F741A145103' \
  -derivedDataPath ios/build build

# Install
xcrun devicectl device install app --device E2095CDC-E117-527C-818A-9F741A145103 \
  ios/build/Build/Products/Release-iphoneos/calorietracker.app

# Launch
xcrun devicectl device process launch --device E2095CDC-E117-527C-818A-9F741A145103 com.apoorvdarshan.calorietracker

# Pass --reset-onboarding to test the onboarding flow:
xcrun devicectl device process launch --device E2095CDC-E117-527C-818A-9F741A145103 com.apoorvdarshan.calorietracker -- --reset-onboarding
```

## Tests (iOS)

`calorietrackerTests` and `calorietrackerUITests` targets exist but only contain Xcode boilerplate — there are no real tests. Verify behavior by hand on device. If you do add tests, run them with:

```bash
xcodebuild test -project ios/calorietracker.xcodeproj -scheme calorietracker \
  -destination 'id=E2095CDC-E117-527C-818A-9F741A145103'
```

## Code Review

Use Codex CLI before each PR / after each commit cluster:

```bash
codex exec review --commit <SHA> --full-auto
```

Address P1 and P2 findings. P3 is judgment-call.

## Architecture (iOS)

### State / Dependency Injection

All stores use Swift's `@Observable` macro (not `ObservableObject`) and are injected with `.environment(...)` (not `.environmentObject(...)`). Created once in `calorietrackerApp.swift` and shared:

- `FoodStore` — food entries, favorites, macro aggregates
- `WeightStore` — weight entries; `addEntry` auto-syncs `profile.weightKg` to latest
- `ProfileStore` — **source of truth for `UserProfile`**. All reads/writes go through `profileStore.profile`. It listens for `.userProfileDidChange` and reloads so external writers (WeightStore, HealthKit observer) propagate to every view.
- `ChatStore` — Coach conversation history (persisted in UserDefaults as JSON, capped at last 20 messages in LLM payload)
- `NotificationManager`, `HealthKitManager`

Build setting `SWIFT_DEFAULT_ACTOR_ISOLATION = MainActor` means most types are main-actor isolated by default. New files are auto-discovered via `PBXFileSystemSynchronizedRootGroup` — **do not** edit `project.pbxproj` to register source files. (The `knownRegions` entry in pbxproj *is* edited when adding a new localization.)

### AI / LLM Routing (13 providers, 3 formats)

Two services, both route to the same 13 providers via `AIProvider.apiFormat`:

- **`GeminiService`** (`Services/GeminiService.swift`) — single-shot food/label analysis. Methods: `analyzeFood`, `analyzeTextInput`, `autoAnalyze`, `analyzeNutritionLabel`. All funnel through `callAI`.
- **`ChatService`** (`Services/ChatService.swift`) — multi-turn Coach chat. Builds a fresh system prompt every turn from the live profile + forecast + recent weights/foods, sends history + new user message.

The three API dialects are:
- **Gemini** (`.gemini`): `POST /models/{model}:generateContent` with `systemInstruction` + `contents[{role, parts}]`. API key goes in `X-goog-api-key` header, not the URL.
- **Anthropic Messages** (`.anthropic`): `POST /messages` with `system` + `messages` array, `x-api-key` header + `anthropic-version: 2023-06-01`.
- **OpenAI-compatible** (`.openaiCompatible`): `POST /chat/completions` with `messages` array (system + user/assistant). Used by OpenAI, xAI Grok, OpenRouter, Together AI, Groq, **Hugging Face** (router for open-weight models — Gemma, Qwen VL, Llama Vision), **Fireworks AI**, **DeepInfra** (open-weight hosts), **Mistral** (Pixtral vision), Ollama (local), and the **Custom (OpenAI-compatible)** provider where the user supplies their own base URL + free-form model name. OpenRouter and Hugging Face both set `supportsCustomModelName = true` so users can type any model ID alongside the preset list.

Adding a provider: add a case to `AIProvider` in `Models/AIProvider.swift`, set `baseURL`/`models`/`apiFormat`/`apiKeyPlaceholder`. If `apiFormat` is `.openaiCompatible` it works automatically; otherwise add a branch in both `GeminiService.callAI` and `ChatService.sendMessage`.

Transient 503/529/429 responses auto-retry with 1s/2s/4s backoff before surfacing the error — so "model overloaded" spikes usually resolve invisibly. This applies to **both** services (`GeminiService.makeRequest` and `ChatService.send`); if you add a third LLM entry point, port the same loop. On final failure, both services convert status codes to user-friendly copy ("The AI provider is overloaded right now. We retried a few times…") — don't surface raw `HTTP 503` / provider JSON messages.

### Speech-to-Text Routing (5 providers)

`VoiceInputView` branches on `SpeechSettings.selectedProvider`:
- **Native iOS** — `SFSpeechRecognizer` live streaming with partial results. One-tap: tap Analyze to stop + submit.
- **Remote** (OpenAI Whisper / Groq / Deepgram / AssemblyAI) — `AVAudioRecorder` writes 16 kHz mono AAC to a temp m4a, uploads on stop, `SpeechService.transcribe` returns final text. Two-tap flow so user can review the transcription before Analyze.

OpenAI + Groq share `/v1/audio/transcriptions` (multipart). Deepgram takes raw audio body with `Token <key>` auth. AssemblyAI is a 3-step flow: upload → submit → poll every 1s up to 60s.

### Coach chat (`ChatView` + `ChatStore` + `ChatService`)

- 5th tab in `ContentView` TabView (Home / Progress / Coach / Settings / About).
- `ChatStore` persists the full conversation in UserDefaults. `contextMessages()` returns the last 20 for the LLM payload (token-cost cap); the full history stays visible locally regardless.
- `ChatService.buildSystemPrompt` includes: profile (gender/age/height/weight/activity/goal + body fat if set), **which BMR formula is active** (Katch-McArdle if body fat known, else Mifflin-St Jeor), BMR/TDEE numbers, macro targets, `WeightAnalysisService.compute` output (predicted/observed trends, 30/60/90-day weight, days-to-goal, under-logging flag), last 10 weight entries, last 7 days of daily calorie totals.
- Goal-aware prompt chips — `ChatView.promptChips` returns a different set for Lose / Gain / Maintain.

### Weight forecast math (`WeightAnalysisService`)

Pure function. Uses up to 90 days of available data (auto-scales to however much the user actually has). Returns a `WeightForecast` with:
- `predictedWeeklyChangeKg` — from energy balance vs TDEE (7700 kcal ≈ 1 kg)
- `observedWeeklyChangeKg` — linear regression on weight entries in window (nil if <2 entries)
- 30/60/90-day predictions, `daysToGoal` if direction matches, `trendsDisagree` flag when predicted and observed differ by >0.3 kg/week

Used exclusively as context for `ChatService` — no standalone UI card (there used to be one; it was removed in favor of the Coach tab).

### FoodStore → HealthKit callbacks

`FoodStore` exposes four hooks that `calorietrackerApp.wireUpHealthKit()` wires to `HealthKitManager`:
- `onEntryAdded` → `writeNutrition(for:)` (immediate, synchronous)
- `onEntryDeleted` → `deleteNutrition(entryID:)`
- `onEntryUpdated` → `updateNutrition(for:)` (delete-then-write, awaited so they don't race)
- `onEntriesChanged` → notification rescheduling

Edits use `onEntryUpdated` rather than back-to-back delete+add so HealthKit can serialize the two operations atomically.

### WeightStore → HealthKit callbacks

- `onEntryAdded` → `writeWeight(for:)` — tags each HK sample with `fudai_weight_id = entry.id.uuidString`
- `onEntryDeleted` → `deleteWeight(entryID:)` — deletes by metadata predicate, bypasses the `healthKitEnabled` flag

`WeightStore.addEntry` also detects goal-weight crossings (previous-on-wrong-side → new-on-correct-side) and posts `.weightGoalReached` — the Progress tab listens and shows "Congratulations!".

**`WeightStore.init()` does NOT seed a starter entry.** An earlier version did, falling back to `UserProfile.default` (70 kg) when the store initialized before onboarding finished — that dropped a phantom 70 kg entry onto every fresh user's chart regardless of their real starting weight. The seed now runs from `calorietrackerApp.onChange(of: hasCompletedOnboarding)` via `weightStore.seedInitialWeightFromProfileIfEmpty(profile.weightKg)` once the profile is real. The method is idempotent (no-ops when `entries` is non-empty). Don't reintroduce an init-time seed.

`HealthKitManager.writeWeight(kg:date:)` (the profile-state push used by onboarding/Settings, not the per-entry variant) also tags samples with a synthetic `fudai_weight_id = UUID().uuidString`. Untagged samples are invisible to `deleteWeight(entryID:)`'s metadata predicate.

### HealthKit Conventions

`HealthKitManager` (`Stores/HealthKitManager.swift`) is the only HealthKit boundary.

- **`typesVersion`** (renamed from the old `authVersion` to dodge a CodeQL heuristic on "auth" keywords) is bumped when new HealthKit types are added. `needsReauthorization` returns `max(typesVersionKey, legacy healthKitAuthVersion)` < current so existing users aren't re-prompted after the rename.
- `requestAuthorization` only persists the new version via `persistCurrentTypesVersion()` when **all** dietary share types are `.sharingAuthorized`, so users who deny nutrition can re-prompt.
- Each nutrition sample carries `fudai_entry_id` metadata; each weight sample carries `fudai_weight_id`. Deletion uses metadata predicates.
- `writeNutrition` guards on `healthKitEnabled`. `deleteNutrition` and the delete half of `updateNutrition` always run (even with sync off) so in-app edits/deletes still clean up samples that were exported before the user flipped sync off — otherwise those would orphan in Apple Health forever.
- `backfillNutritionIfNeeded` is idempotent (queries Apple Health for each entry's UUID before writing) and is guarded by `isBackfillingNutrition` so scene-phase re-entry can't spawn overlapping scans. The caller passes `currentEntryIDs: () -> Set<UUID>` so a meal deleted mid-backfill won't be re-exported as a phantom sample.
- The body-measurements observer skips adding weights whose sample metadata contains `fudai_weight_id` — those are our own writes and are handled by `WeightStore.addEntry` directly. External samples (Apple Watch, scale, Health app entry) go through the observer's date+value dedup and get added to `WeightStore` with the sample's real date.
- `startBodyMeasurementObserver()` calls `stopObserver()` **first** before registering the three `HKObserverQuery` instances. `wireUpHealthKit()` runs on every scene-active, so without the tear-down the `observerQueries` array kept growing and one HK change would fire the callback N times per session.

Clear Food Log keeps Apple Health samples (per product spec — only saves storage). **Delete All Data is local-only too**: it wipes in-memory stores, UserDefaults, Keychain API keys, the Coach chat history, and the widget App Group snapshot — but intentionally does NOT touch Apple Health. Health data is user-owned and personal; if they want it gone they can use the Health app's Sources → Fud AI panel. (Earlier revisions purged HK nutrition in this flow; that was reverted in favor of treating HK as read/write-while-synced but untouched on resets.)

### Widgets (`FudAIWidgetsExtension` target + App Group)

The widget extension lives in the `ios/FudAIWidgets/` folder as its own target (`com.apoorvdarshan.calorietracker.FudAIWidgets`). It's embedded into the main app via the `Embed Foundation Extensions` copy phase. Five supported families: `.systemSmall`, `.systemMedium`, `.accessoryCircular`, `.accessoryRectangular`, `.accessoryInline`.

Because widgets run in a separate process, they can't read the main app's `UserDefaults`. Data flows through an **App Group** shared container:
- **App Group ID**: `group.com.apoorvdarshan.calorietracker` (declared in both `ios/calorietracker/calorietracker.entitlements` and `ios/FudAIWidgets/FudAIWidgets.entitlements` — must match exactly).
- **`WidgetSnapshot`** is a small Codable struct (today's totals + goals) written by the main app into the shared suite under key `widget_snapshot_v1`.
- **Duplicated file**: `ios/calorietracker/Services/WidgetSnapshot.swift` and `ios/FudAIWidgets/WidgetSnapshot.swift` are identical copies. The widget target can't see the main app's sources (auto-discovery via `PBXFileSystemSynchronizedRootGroup` is per-target), so we keep two files in sync manually. If you change one, change both.
- **`WidgetSnapshotWriter.publish(...)`** (main app only) recomputes today's totals, writes the snapshot, and calls `WidgetCenter.shared.reloadAllTimelines()`. Called from three places in `calorietrackerApp.swift`: on `foodStore.onEntriesChanged`, on `.userProfileDidChange` notification (goal edits), and on scene-phase `.active` (so midnight rollover doesn't require an explicit food change).
- **Callback-wiring gotcha**: `wireUpFoodStoreCallback()` (where the `onEntriesChanged` closure gets installed) must run on **every** scene-active, not just the onboarding `false→true` transition. The `.onChange(of: hasCompletedOnboarding)` branch only fires once ever; if it were the sole wire-up site, existing users who completed onboarding before this code landed would never get the widget-refresh callback installed and would have to open the app to see new entries. Closure assignment is idempotent, so re-wiring on scene-active is safe.
- **Timeline policy**: `CalorieProvider.getTimeline` emits one entry for "now" and refreshes after 30 minutes as a safety net for days when the user doesn't log anything.
- **Freshness rules baked into the data layer** (don't regress these):
  1. `ios/FudAIWidgets/WidgetSnapshot.read()` returns `nil` when `snapshot.dayStart` isn't today. The widget then falls back to `.empty` (zeroed today). Without this the 30-min timeline refresh kept showing yesterday's totals past midnight.
  2. `WidgetSnapshotWriter.publish(...)` filters entries with `Calendar.isDate($0.timestamp, inSameDayAs: Date())` — NOT a plain `>= startOfDay`. The latter would fold tomorrow-dated entries (pre-logged via the week strip) into today's widget totals.
  3. `WidgetSnapshot.clear()` is called from Delete All Data and from `refreshWidgetSnapshot()` when no profile is loaded. The App Group container sits outside `UserDefaults.standard`, so `removePersistentDomain` doesn't touch it — without `clear()` the widget would keep showing the previous profile's numbers after a reset.

Adding a new widget: add a new `Widget` conforming type in `ios/FudAIWidgets/`, add it to `FudAIWidgetsBundle.body`, extend `CalorieWidgetView`'s `@Environment(\.widgetFamily)` switch if you're adding a new family. If you need additional data, extend `WidgetSnapshot` in **both** files (add fields with Codable defaults so old snapshots still decode).

### Localization (15 languages)

The app ships with `ios/calorietracker/Localizable.xcstrings` (String Catalog) — ~200 UI strings × 15 locales: `en` (source), `ar`, `az`, `de`, `es`, `fr`, `hi`, `it`, `ja`, `ko`, `nl`, `pt-BR`, `ro`, `ru`, `zh-Hans`.

No in-app language picker. iOS auto-selects from the device language (matches Cal AI / MyFitnessPal / Yazio).

**Rule when adding UI strings**: every new `Text("...")`, `Button("...")`, `Section("...")`, `.alert("...")`, `.navigationTitle("...")`, placeholder, etc. must land in the catalog with translations for all 14 non-English locales before commit. For batches of 10+ strings spawn a general-purpose agent with the translation prompt (see prior commits for the format), merge the JSON into the catalog via a small Python script. `SWIFT_EMIT_LOC_STRINGS = YES` is set — Xcode auto-extracts new English strings on build, but will leave non-English entries empty; fill them in manually before shipping. Adding a new language requires a new code in the catalog + a new `knownRegions` entry in `ios/calorietracker.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj`.

### UI Structure

- `ContentView` hosts a **5-tab layout**: Home, Progress, Coach, Settings, About.
- `OnboardingView` is the first-run flow including an AI-provider-setup step.
- Sheets and pickers route through a single `.sheet(item: $activeSheet)` driven by an enum to avoid SwiftUI's stacked-sheet bugs.
- `Views/Theme.swift` (`AppColors`) holds the gradient palette used across the app.
- Picker sheets (height, weight, body-fat, calories/macros) seed their `@State` in `init()`, not `.onAppear`, to avoid a "flash to default value" on open.
- **Share sheets use `ActivityShareSheet`** (a `UIViewControllerRepresentable` over `UIActivityViewController` defined in `ContentView.swift`) — **not** SwiftUI's `ShareLink`. SwiftUI's `ShareLink(item: URL, message:)` silently drops the `message` arg for most share targets (Messages, Mail, X), so only the URL gets shared. Wrapping `UIActivityViewController` with `[String, URL]` in `activityItems` forwards both: iMessage shows the text plus the URL preview, Mail uses the text as body. Used by About → Share the App.

## Build, Install, Launch (Android)

Kotlin + Jetpack Compose client. Target device is Apoorv's iQOO Z9 5G on OriginOS 6 (Android 15). Min SDK 26 (bumped from 24 for Health Connect).

```bash
# From /Users/ApoorvDarshan/fud-ai/android
export JAVA_HOME="/Applications/Android Studio.app/Contents/jbr/Contents/Home"

# Build
./gradlew :app:assembleDebug

# Install
adb install -r app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk

# Launch
adb shell am start -n com.apoorvdarshan.calorietracker/.MainActivity

# Launch with onboarding reset (equivalent to iOS --reset-onboarding)
adb shell am start -n com.apoorvdarshan.calorietracker/.MainActivity --ez reset_onboarding true

# Tail logs
adb logcat -s FudAI:* AndroidRuntime:E
```

**adb is not on PATH** on Apoorv's machine — the binary lives at `~/Library/Android/sdk/platform-tools/adb`. Either alias it or use the absolute path; `command not found: adb` from a fresh shell is the giveaway.

**Debug builds install side-by-side with the Play Store release**, never overwriting it. `buildTypes.debug` sets `applicationIdSuffix = ".debug"` + `versionNameSuffix = "-debug"` so `:app:assembleDebug` produces `com.apoorvdarshan.calorietracker.debug` — separate package, separate DataStore, separate widgets. Apoorv has the live closed-test build (`com.apoorvdarshan.calorietracker`, signed by the production keystore) installed from Play Store; for any iteration on device, **always use the debug variant** so that production install + its real-user state stay intact. Targeting the debug package in adb commands looks like:

```bash
adb install -r app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk
adb shell am start -n com.apoorvdarshan.calorietracker.debug/com.apoorvdarshan.calorietracker.MainActivity
adb shell am start -n com.apoorvdarshan.calorietracker.debug/com.apoorvdarshan.calorietracker.MainActivity --ez reset_onboarding true
```

The launcher icon stays as plain "Fud AI" for both (no `app_name` override) — Apoorv distinguishes by install order / icon position.

OriginOS quirks: USB debugging needs **two** toggles enabled (USB debugging + USB debugging Security settings under Developer options). After first install, whitelist Fud AI in battery optimization so alarm-based reminders survive. Forcing dark/light mode via `cmd uimode night yes|no` or `settings put secure ui_night_mode` is **silently ignored** by the OEM skin — to verify both themes either toggle the Appearance picker inside Fud AI (Settings → Appearance → System / Light / Dark, persisted in DataStore and read by `MainActivity`'s `FudAITheme(darkTheme = ...)` wrap) or flip the OS Settings → Display switch by hand.

## Tests (Android)

No automated tests yet — matches iOS policy. Validate by hand on device. `calorietrackerTests`-equivalent scaffolding lives at `android/app/src/androidTest/` and `src/test/` but only contains Android Studio boilerplate.

### State / DI

Manual DI via `FudAIApp.container` (an `AppContainer` singleton). No Hilt — repositories and services are instantiated once in `FudAIApp.onCreate()` and handed to ViewModels via a `ViewModelProvider.Factory` pattern. Screens pull ViewModels with `viewModel(factory = ...)`.

Reactive reads go through `Flow<T>`. Each ViewModel exposes a `StateFlow<UiState>` that screens collect via `collectAsState()`. Matches iOS `@Observable` + `.environment()` in spirit.

### AI routing (13 providers, 3 API formats)

Matches iOS semantically:
- **Gemini** → `GeminiClient` (POST `/models/{model}:generateContent`, `X-goog-api-key` header).
- **Anthropic Messages** → `AnthropicClient` (POST `/messages`, `x-api-key` + `anthropic-version: 2023-06-01`).
- **OpenAI-compatible** → `OpenAICompatibleClient` — covers OpenAI, xAI, OpenRouter, Together AI, Groq, Hugging Face, Fireworks, DeepInfra, Mistral, Ollama, and Custom.

`FoodAnalysisService` and `ChatService` both dispatch by `AIProvider.apiFormat`. `RetryPolicy` does 1s/2s/4s exponential backoff on 503/429/529. Error copy surfaces friendly messages ("provider is overloaded", "API key rejected") instead of raw HTTP codes.

### Speech-to-text

- Native: `android.speech.SpeechRecognizer` wrapped as a cold `Flow<SttEvent>` with streaming partials.
- Remote (Whisper / Groq / Deepgram / AssemblyAI): `AudioRecorder` writes 16 kHz mono AAC to cache, then the per-provider client uploads + parses.

### Health Connect (replaces HealthKit)

Single boundary in `HealthConnectManager`. Weight + Nutrition read/write with `Metadata.manualEntry(clientRecordId = "fudai_<uuid>")` for dedup. Change-token loop for external weight imports (Samsung Health, Withings, Fitbit via Health Connect). Requires **Min SDK 26** — that's why `minSdk = 26` in `app/build.gradle.kts` (Android Studio default was 24).

### Persistence

| iOS | Android |
|---|---|
| UserDefaults JSON blobs | DataStore Preferences + kotlinx.serialization |
| iOS Keychain | EncryptedSharedPreferences (AES-256) |
| Application Support/ | `context.filesDir/fudai-food-images/` |
| App Group shared UserDefaults | Widget reads same DataStore (widget runs in same process on Android by default) |

### UI

5-tab bottom navigation (Home / Progress / Coach / Settings / About) mirroring iOS `ContentView`. NavHost hides the bar on the onboarding route. Design system matches iOS — pink `#FF375F → #FF6B8A` gradient, cream/dark semantic backgrounds, rounded typography via `FontFamily.Default` (Nunito can be swapped in if desired).

### Localization (Android)

Same 15-language coverage as iOS, but Android resolves via Android resource qualifiers instead of a String Catalog:

- `app/src/main/res/values/strings.xml` — English source (~509 keys)
- `app/src/main/res/values-{ar,az,de,es,fr,hi,it,ja,ko,nl,pt-rBR,ro,ru,zh-rCN}/strings.xml` — per-locale catalogs
- Android picks the right file at runtime from `Locale.getDefault()` — no in-app picker, matches iOS

**Enum displayName pattern**: model enums (`Gender`, `ActivityLevel`, `WeightGoal`, `MealType`, `AIProvider`, `SpeechProvider`, `AutoBalanceMacro`) expose `@get:StringRes val displayNameRes: Int` instead of a hardcoded `displayName: String`. Call sites wrap in `stringResource(it.displayNameRes)`. When adding a new enum case, add the matching `<string>` in `values/strings.xml` plus all 14 locale files.

**Composable scope gotcha**: `stringResource(...)` only works inside `@Composable` functions. `LazyColumn { ... }` lambdas have `LazyListScope` (not @Composable), so resolve strings before the LazyColumn and capture them in the closure — the existing `EditFoodEntrySheet.kt` "More Nutrition" block hoists `gUnit`/`mgUnit`/`micros` for exactly this reason.

**Glance widgets** can't use `stringResource` directly; they use `LocalContext.current.getString(R.string.x)` instead.

### Release Build & Signing (Android)

Release config in `app/build.gradle.kts` enables `isMinifyEnabled = true` + `isShrinkResources = true` for production. Without these, the APK is ~29 MB; with R8 it's ~4.4 MB.

**Signing**: `signingConfigs.release` reads from `android/keystore.properties` (gitignored — see `keystore.properties.template`). When the file is absent (fresh checkout, CI without secrets), the build still succeeds and emits an unsigned APK. The keystore itself lives at `~/Documents/fudai-keystore/fudai-release.jks` outside the repo. **Losing the keystore means a 1–2 week recovery flow with Google's Play App Signing reset** — back it up to a password manager + offsite.

Build the AAB Play Console wants:
```bash
./gradlew :app:bundleRelease
# output: app/build/outputs/bundle/release/app-release.aab
```

**Shipped artifacts live in `android/release/`** (tracked in git, ~24 MB and growing). After every Play-Store-bound build, copy the signed outputs into that folder as `fudai-v<MARKETING>.aab` + `fudai-v<MARKETING>.apk` and commit them — this gives us an offline archive of every Play Console upload so a side-load reproducer (or an internal-track recovery) is always one `git checkout` away. Older versions are never deleted.

**ProGuard/R8 keep rules** (`app/proguard-rules.pro`) — these caught real release-only crashes during prep, don't strip them:

1. **kotlinx.serialization** — every `@Serializable` data class is reflected at runtime to find its generated `$$serializer` companion. Without keep rules, DataStore + widget snapshot decode fails with `NoSuchMethodError: serializer()`.
2. **WorkManager + Room** — Glance uses WorkManager internally, which uses Room for `WorkDatabase`. R8 strips the `@Database` class without explicit keeps, crashing `Application.onCreate` with `Failed to create an instance of androidx.work.impl.WorkDatabase`.
3. **Glance widgets** — `CalorieAppWidget` / `ProteinAppWidget` are loaded reflectively from `AndroidManifest.xml`; keep the whole `widget/` package.
4. **Health Connect** — defensive keep on `androidx.health.connect.client.records.**` even though the AAR ships consumer rules.

If a release build crashes but debug works, R8 stripping is the first suspect — check `app/build/outputs/mapping/release/missing_rules.txt`.

**Verify the release APK before uploading**: `./gradlew :app:assembleRelease` → sign with the keystore (or debug-sign with `apksigner` for sideload testing) → install → exercise the surfaces that hit reflection (food log persistence, widget refresh, KeyStore reads) on device.

## Website (`web/`)

Plain static HTML + CSS — no build step, no framework. Deployed to Vercel with the domain `fud-ai.app`. After the monorepo merge, Vercel's git integration must point at this repo with **Root Directory = `web/`** (previously it pointed at the now-obsolete `apoorvdarshan/fud-ai-web` repo).

- **Pages**: `web/index.html` (landing), `web/privacy.html`, `web/terms.html`.
- **Assets**: `web/assets/` — logo, OG preview image, screenshots used by the landing hero.
- **OG image**: `web/assets/og-preview.png` is referenced with `?v=N` cache-busting in `index.html` meta tags. Bump the version when replacing the image so X / Facebook / LinkedIn re-scrape.
- **SEO**: `web/robots.txt`, `web/sitemap.xml`.
- **Preview locally**: any static server, e.g. `cd web && python3 -m http.server 8000`.

## Gotchas (Android)

- **EncryptedSharedPreferences AEAD recovery**: on Android 14/15 the AndroidKeystore master-key alias survives `pm uninstall` but the encrypted prefs file does not, so a reinstall hits `javax.crypto.AEADBadTagException` on first read and crashes `Application.onCreate` before any UI shows. `KeyStore.openOrRecover()` catches this, deletes the prefs file + the master-key alias, and rebuilds. Don't strip the recovery path — losing it means every Play Store update from a wiped install crashes the user.
- **Glance bitmap rasterization**: Glance has no `Canvas` / arc primitives. The pink-gradient progress ring on the Calorie/Protein widgets is rendered into a Bitmap (`widget/RingBitmap.kt`) and passed via `ImageProvider(bitmap)`. Computed in `provideGlance` per recomposition — small enough (~100×100×4 bytes) not to matter.
- **NavController + start destination**: tapping the Home tab while *on* the Home destination is a no-op for `nav.navigate(HOME) { popUpTo(HOME); launchSingleTop = true }`. Use `nav.popBackStack(HOME, inclusive = false)` instead. The bottom-nav code already does this.
- **OriginOS USB debugging**: needs **two** toggles in Developer options — USB debugging *plus* USB debugging (Security settings). Without the second one, `adb install` works but `adb shell input tap` and `am start --es ...` extras get blocked.
- **OriginOS battery optimization**: `AlarmManager.setAndAllowWhileIdle` reminders get killed unless the app is whitelisted. Settings exposes a deep-link to the per-app whitelist via `Settings.ACTION_REQUEST_IGNORE_BATTERY_OPTIMIZATIONS` (with a fallback chain to `ACTION_IGNORE_BATTERY_OPTIMIZATION_SETTINGS` + `ACTION_APPLICATION_DETAILS_SETTINGS` for OEMs that block the direct intent).
- **No exact alarms**: reminders use the inexact `setAndAllowWhileIdle` path, never `setExactAndAllowWhileIdle`. Play Console blocks `USE_EXACT_ALARM` for any app whose core function isn't a calendar or alarm clock — Fud AI is neither, and the v1.0.0 closed-test upload was rejected the one time we shipped that permission. The manifest deliberately omits both `USE_EXACT_ALARM` and `SCHEDULE_EXACT_ALARM`. A daily streak/summary nudge that fires within a few minutes of the chosen time is fine for this use case; don't reintroduce exact alarms.
- **DataStore singleton**: `Context.fudaiDataStore` is a `preferencesDataStore` extension. Both the main app process and widget receivers call `PreferencesStore(context)` and get the same backing DataStore as long as the application context is used — that's how widgets see writes from the app without IPC. Don't reach for a separate widget store.
- **Drag-to-reorder inside ModalBottomSheet** is fundamentally fragile on Android — the sheet's drag-to-dismiss and any internal vertical scroll compete for the same gesture. Favorites in Saved Meals uses native ↑/↓ buttons (`MoveButtons`) instead. If you reach for drag-to-reorder again, expect to fight it.
- **Light-mode visibility for white-on-glass overlays**: the iOS-26-style liquid-glass + button on the Home top bar uses `Color.White` at 0.22/0.08 alpha, which reads against `AppBackgroundDark` (#0C0C0C) but completely vanishes against `AppBackgroundLight` (#FFF8F2) — the v1.0.1 build shipped with an invisible + button in light mode. Fix lives in `HomeScreen.kt`: `MaterialTheme.colorScheme.background.luminance() < 0.5f` decides which fill+border to use, swapping in the brand pink gradient (`AppColors.CalorieStart` → `AppColors.CalorieEnd`) for light mode. **Use `MaterialTheme.colorScheme.background.luminance()` rather than `isSystemInDarkTheme()`** when branching styles — OriginOS overrides uimode at the OEM layer and the two can drift, so the rendered theme is the only reliable source of truth. The same swap applies to any other glass overlay you add (Coach FAB, Saved-Meals header, etc.).

## Gotchas (iOS)

- **SourceKit false positives**: editing surfaces "no module 'UIKit'" / "Cannot find type 'FoodEntry' in scope" errors that are not real. Build with `xcodebuild` to verify.
- **`.buttonStyle(.plain)` kills row tap-highlight** in a `List`. Use `.tint(.primary)` if you want the highlight while keeping primary text color.
- **Multiple `.sheet()` modifiers** on the same view cause white/black-screen bugs. Always use a single `.sheet(item:)` driven by an enum.
- **`ProgressView`** is renamed to `ProgressTabView` to avoid clashing with SwiftUI's built-in `ProgressView`.
- **`@Observable` tracking can miss property access buried in computed vars.** HomeView, ProgressTabView, and NutritionDetailView each read `let _ = profileStore.profile` at the top of `body` to force observation tracking. Don't remove those lines.
- **Dead files** (kept for git history but not referenced anywhere): `StoreManager.swift`, `PaywallView.swift`, `SpinWheelView.swift`, `CloudKitService.swift`. Don't add new code to them.
- **Persistent state** lives in two places: `UserDefaults` (preferences + JSON-encoded `entries`/`weights`/`favorites`/`coachChatHistory` arrays + `*Enabled`/`*Reminder*` keys read via `@AppStorage`) and iOS Keychain (LLM + STT API keys via `KeychainHelper`). There is no Core Data / SwiftData / iCloud.
- **CodeQL is not configured** anymore — the workflow was removed because it produced almost entirely false positives on UserDefaults writes near "auth"-keyword variables for a local-only app with no auth flows.

## Commit Style

- Plain factual messages. No co-author trailer. No marketing language.
- Commit and push immediately after each working change.
- When a commit adds user-facing strings, the message should mention the catalog was updated.

## Release Artifacts

- **`APPSTORE.md`** (repo root) holds the App Store Connect listing copy for iOS — name, subtitle, promo text, keywords, What's New, full description, reviewer notes. Update it whenever the iOS version bumps; the current header is `v3.1`. Uploads to App Store Connect happen by hand-pasting from this file — don't let it drift from the code.
- **`PLAYSTORE.md`** (repo root) is the Android-side equivalent for the Play Console — short + full description, Data Safety answers, App Content declarations, reviewer notes. Header is `v1.0.0`.
- **App Store screenshots** live in `~/Documents/fud ai/appstore screenshots/` (raw 1179×2556 captures from device) and get composited into 1242×2688 marketing PNGs by ad-hoc Python scripts in `/tmp/`. The scripts are not in the repo — they're rebuilt per release. The current iteration uses PIL gradient backgrounds + a pixel-perfect iPhone 15 Pro Max frame + Bricolage Grotesque ExtraBold typography.
- Bump `MARKETING_VERSION` in `ios/calorietracker.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj` (two occurrences — main app + widget extension) before each App Store submission. `CURRENT_PROJECT_VERSION` is the build number.
